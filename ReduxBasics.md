### **Redux Overview**

#### **What is Redux?**
Redux is a state management library designed to handle state efficiently in large applications. It ensures:
- **Centralized State**: All data (state) is stored in a single, central location.
- **Consistency**: Updates to the state are predictable and follow specific rules.
- **Ease of Access**: Multiple parts of the app can easily access the same data.

**Example Comparison**  
Without Redux: Each React component maintains its own version of the state, leading to inconsistencies.  
With Redux:
- Thereâ€™s a single "logbook" (store).
- Components (workers) must request a "manager" (dispatch actions) to update the state.

### **Key Redux Concepts**

1. **Store**: The centralized container for the application state.
2. **Actions**: Plain objects that describe what needs to be done.
3. **Reducers**: Functions that specify how the state should change based on the action.
4. **Dispatch**: A function used to send actions to the store.
5. **Selectors**: Functions used to extract specific parts of the state.

### **Attributes vs. Props**

- **Attributes**:
  - Used with built-in HTML elements like `<div>` or `<img>`.
  - Example:  
    ```jsx
    <div className="class1"></div>
    ```
    Here, `className` is an HTML attribute.

- **Props**:
  - Passed to React components like `<Header />`.
  - Example:  
    ```jsx
    <Header name={name} />
    ```
    Here, `name` is a prop passed to the `Header` component.

### **Redux Flow**

1. **Component dispatches an action** (e.g., `addItem`).
2. **Store receives the action** and forwards it to the reducer.
3. **Reducer processes the action** and updates the state.
4. **Components re-render** with the updated state.

### **Code Example: App with Redux**

#### **App Component**
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Provider, useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux'; // React-Redux hooks
import store from './store'; // Redux store
import { addItem } from './actions'; // Action creator

const App = () => (
  <Provider store={store}> {/* Makes store available to all components */}
    <Cart />
    <Product />
  </Provider>
);

const Cart = () => {
  const cart = useSelector((state) => state.cart); // Access the cart state from Redux
  return <div>Cart Items: {cart.join(', ')}</div>;
};

const Product = () => {
  const dispatch = useDispatch(); // Get dispatch function to send actions

  const addToCart = () => dispatch(addItem('New Product')); // Dispatch action
  return <button onClick={addToCart}>Add to Cart</button>;
};

export default App;
```

---

#### **Store Configuration (store.js)**
```javascript
import { createStore } from 'redux'; // Import Redux's createStore function
import reducer from './reducer'; // Import the reducer (explained below)

// Create the store with the reducer
const store = createStore(reducer);

export default store; // Export the store to use in the app
```

---

#### **Actions (actions.js)**
```javascript
// Action creator
export const addItem = (item) => ({
  type: 'ADD_ITEM', // Action type
  payload: item, // Data to be added to the state
});
```

---

#### **Reducer (reducer.js)**
```javascript
const initialState = { cart: [] }; // Initial state of the app

// Reducer function
const reducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'ADD_ITEM': // Action type
      return {
        ...state, // Copy existing state
        cart: [...state.cart, action.payload], // Add new item to cart
      };
    default:
      return state; // Return unchanged state for unknown actions
  }
};

export default reducer; // Export reducer for the store
```

---

### **Summary of Key Redux Concepts**

1. **Store**: Central state container.
2. **Reducer**: Specifies how the state changes based on actions.
3. **Actions**: Objects describing what to do.
4. **Provider**: Makes the store available to React components.
5. **useSelector**: Accesses state from the store.
6. **useDispatch**: Sends actions to the store.

---

### **Step-by-Step Execution Flow of Redux Code**

1. **App Initialization**:
   - The `Provider` component makes the Redux store available to all child components.

2. **Rendering the App**:
   - The `App` component renders its children (`Cart`, `Product`).

3. **Dispatching an Action**:
   - User interaction (e.g., clicking a button) triggers `dispatch`, which sends an action to the Redux store.

4. **Reducer Processes Action**:
   - The store calls the reducer with the current state and the action.
   - The reducer updates the state based on the action type.

5. **State Update and Component Re-render**:
   - The Redux store updates its state.
   - Components using `useSelector` automatically re-render with the updated state.

---

### **Recap**
1. The `App` component is wrapped in a `Provider` to share the store with child components.
2. Components use `useSelector` to fetch data and `useDispatch` to send actions.
3. User interactions trigger actions.
4. Reducers handle state updates based on action types.
5. Updated state causes components to re-render with new data.
