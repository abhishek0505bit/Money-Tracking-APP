1) It was not pushing, and showing error?
- the issue was due to large node modules files, It was unable to push it..
- so we installed git lfs using terminal first so that we can use it in our vs terminal:
        ``` brew install git-lfs```
- once this is done, we move to vs terminal:
        git reset --soft HEAD~1
    - add api/node_modules to .gitignore, for future untracking
    - Untrack node_modules so Git stops monitoring it:    
        git rm -r --cached node_modules: This will remove the folder from Git's tracking (but not delete it locally).
    - Re commit your changes and push it
